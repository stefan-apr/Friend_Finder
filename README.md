# Friend_Finder

This application is a personality-matching platform developed using NodeJS and Express. It can be thought of as being similar to a simple
dating app. Users are able to create a profile by first inputting information into a number of data fields. Then, the user is given a personality survey of ten questions to take. Once that is complete, the user will be shown the name, username, and user image of the user that most matches their own responses. 

The user is also able to view the raw JSON data that describes all of the Friend profiles. They are also able to clear the database if they would like, after which a single placeholder Friend profile is added. These functions exist for debugging and testing purposes and any published build would of course cut them.

Many additional features are in consideration, such as persistent user accounts, being able to open chat conversations with other users, careful input validation to ensure user data input conforms to the desired formats, et cetera.
